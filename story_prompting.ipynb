      "Rationale: The text describes a UML diagram of the OpenTracks application, detailing various activities and transitions between them. The actions include starting and stopping track recording, adding markers, and sharing files, which involve collecting and processing data. The data types referenced include usage data, such as app interactions and device information, as well as location data, given the context of tracking and mapping activities. The purposes are primarily related to functionality, as the application is designed to track and record activities, but also include analytics and customization, as users can view aggregated statistics and edit tracks. Tracking is implied through the recording and mapping of tracks.\n"
