ProcessWire uses a role-based access control system (RBAC). Users are assigned to one or more roles, each role is assigned permissions, and roles are assigned to templates for access control of pages.
Roles
Roles are a way of grouping multiple users and assigning permissions to that group. They are the connection of both users and templates to permissions.
Permissions
Permissions represent a granular permission to access something or to perform some action. This page outlines permissions recognized by the core.
